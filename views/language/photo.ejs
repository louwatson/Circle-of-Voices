  <h1>Language ~ Photographs</h1>
  <p>Photography belongs to the traditional methods of visual anthropology and for decades, it was seen
  as an objective way to record and reveal reality. Anthropologists used to document a culture and its people, and disregard the inherent subjectivity, along with the power structures.
  </br>Nowadays, introspection and reflective methodologies are important aspects of research.
For this project, I was strongly inspired by the guidelines of <a href="http://www.photovoice.org/" target="_blank"><u>PhotoVoice</u></a>, a participatory action research (PAR) method.
   It seeks to bring positive social change in marginalised communities and minorities by providing photographic training. Seeing the world directly through the lense of <a href="/the-women"><u>these women</u></a>, I hope to better
   understand how they perceive language and its importance for the development of their identities.

  It makes me sad that my language is going away... even though I still speak it you know! I learned French when I was 2 years old
  and the Disney movies taught me a lot. Most of the youths in Manawan speak French. I would like to pass on the Atikamekw

  <p>The photography sessions marked the tangible start of the project with <a href="/the-women" target="_blank"><u>the women</u></a>.
     One evening, I sat down with all of them at the bar where <u><a href="/the-women/Jessica-Ann-Watso" target="_blank">Jessica</u></a> worked,
     and I presented the idea of taking pictures together, using the guidelines of PhotoVoice. We listed several
     topics, and I asked them to pick a theme in which they were most interested. I informed myself about their visual
     cultures, how photography was used in their families, and I learned about their skills and curiosity for this medium of expression and representation.
     Two of them had previous experiences and were eager to practice their passion as part of the project.
    The three others had never manipulated a professional camera, and among them, only one was curious to try it out.
    We organized several photography sessions during the summer with all the women interested and available, either in small groups or just with me.
    At the beginning, I would give them my camera, and explain the settings. Each woman decided which representations of language they wanted to share.
    Later on, I borrowed a camera, so that we could take pictures together.
    Marie Kristine even bought her own camera, which highly supported the production of photographs and the development of her artistic practice (see her <u><a href="https://mkpetiquay.wixsite.com/mkphotography" target="_blank">website</u></a> here).
    Finally, the photographs were collected during the initial fieldwork as well as online, posted on a private Facebook group.
     For the comments, I came back half a year after my first stay in 2016, and sat down with them individually. By then, I had begun to program the website, so we could do
    the review process in-situ, meaning select the photographs they wanted to display, and add comments, date and place directly in the code.</br></br>

    The work of the visual anthropologist Sarah Pink inspired me greatly because of her ethics and her methodologies. She writes:
     «Ethnographers should be interested in how informants use the content of the images as vessels in which to invest meanings and
      through which to produce and represent their knowledge, self-identities, experiences and emotions.»*</br>
    The photography sessions combined my own experience and practice of facilitating photography with youths, as well as theoretical and practical
      insights from visual anthropology and the participatory action research Photovoice. I saw it as a way to build connection
      with the women (by spending time together doing something we enjoy), to foster their exploration and creativity with digital technology,
      and to co-produce an online space where their perceptions can unfold.

<!--      <h3>Insight into my anthropological journal ~ June 19th 2016, Odanak</h3>
<p>«The participatory session with Raphaelle took place! I felt very honored to be welcomed with so much generosity, simplicity and goodness.
  I felt confortable most of the time and I found particularly interesting to observe my internal patterns, to make them conscious and to oblige myself to keep my mouth shut.
Generally, it was at times hard to stay silent -not to ask questions- and at other times, it felt more natural. The more I kept quiet, the more the silence became familiar. I realized that my ways to help, to show something new, something different, and my approach towards being together,
are largely shaped and defined by my culture. I had to learn to stay at my place, with my words and with my body. I perceived this understanding as part of the process of self-decolonizing (even though it's still unclear to me).
I felt particularly well during the transmission of the story: my function, my role at that time, the space I had reached in such a short amount of time spent with the family.
I was invited to come back, which is always a clear sign that I have been a good guest. I hope the opportunity will present itself.»</p>-->
