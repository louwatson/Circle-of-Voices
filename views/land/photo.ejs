      <h1>Photographs </h1>
      <h3> All the pictures presented here were taken by some of <a href="/the-women"><u>the women</u></a> at the center of the project.</h3>
            <p>Photography belongs to the traditional methods of visual anthropology and for decades, it has been seen
            as an objective way to record and reveal the reality. The anthropologist would document the culture and its people
            from his/her own eye and disregard the inherent subjectivity, along with the power structures.
             For this project, I was strongly inspired by the guidelines of <a href="/www.photovoice.org"><u>PhotoVoice</u></a>, a participatory action research (PAR) method.
             It seeks to bring positive social change in marginalised and minority communities by providing photographic training. Seeing it through their lense, we might better
             understand how they perceive the land and its importance for their identity. </br></br>

            «Ethnographers should be interested in how informants use the content of the images as vessels in which to invest meanings and through which to produce and represent their knowledge, self-identities, experiences and emotions.»*
            The photographs were collected on the ground (during the fieldwork) and online (via a Facebook group).
            The comments were mostly formed during the review process, which happened half a year after my stay.
          </br></br>
            A more detailed account of the whole process and its collaborative dimension can be found in the anthropological notes at the bottom of the page.

<p>The photography workshops constituted the official and tangible start of the project. I myself have been a photographer for about a
  decade and it seemed like the easiest and most fun tool to put in practice. One evening,
I sat down with all of them at the bar where Jessica worked and we discussed the PhotoVoice method. We listed several
topics, and I asked them to pick one in which they were most interested to explore. I informed myself about the visual
culture of the women as well as their skills and curiosity in the area. The outcome presented diverse positions: two of them
had previous experiences and were eager to implement of their passion as part of the project; the others had never manipulated a camera
a camera and among them, only one was curious to try out. For this specific category, several workshops took place, either 1 to 1 or
in small groups. At the beginning, I would simply give them my camera, showing them the settings. Later on, I could lend a camera from friends
and one of the women even bought her own camera, which highly facilitated the production of photographs. </p>
