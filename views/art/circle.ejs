    <h1>Sharing circles</h1>
    <p> Commonly called talking or healing circles, this practice highlights knowledge through personal and collective disclosure.
      Traditionally, sharing circles were used as a format for communication, decision-making and support. Among Indigenous peoples,
      teachings were/are passed through oral traditions, such as stories, requiring listening and observation.
      I consider this method as a way to honour Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies. </br></br>
       Sharing circles can be one of the many active components of self-determination. «As a reflection of traditional world views, sharing circles can facilitate the empowerment
      of First Nations peoples. (...) When First Nations utilize processes that are based upon their views within their communities,
      then the people determine their own destinies.»</br>
      <em>Michael Anthony Hart, Sharing circles:  utilizing traditional practice methods for teaching, helping, and supporting</em>

    </br></br>Drawing on my own previous experiences of facilitating circles in Europe, I hosted this sharing circle the way I learned and felt confortable with.
     As a host, I was mindful of avoiding cultural appropriation, thus I implemented elements that were also representative of my culture and my identity.
    The questions were developped on my own, bringing together personal reflections, and inputs from readings, conversations and various events.
     </br></br>I translated the answers from French into English and I intended to
     keep the balance between staying true to what was shared and emphasizing the most pertinent elements.
     I included my voice because I find it more transparent and honest.
     The circle started with the question:  "How are you today?" and ended with a reflection on the methodology:
     "How did you find it? What would you change/improve?"
     These final thoughts from the women can be found in the anthropological notes at the very bottom.
