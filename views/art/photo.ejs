<h1> Photographs </h1>
<h3> All the pictures presented here were taken by some of <a href="/the-women"><u>the women</u></a> at the center of the project.</h3>
      <p>Photography belongs to the traditional methods of visual anthropology and for decades, it has been seen
      as an objective way to record and reveal the reality. The anthropologist would document the culture and its people
      from his/her own eye and disregard the inherent subjectivity, along with the power structures.
       </br>For this project, I was strongly inspired by the guidelines of <a href="/www.photovoice.org"><u>PhotoVoice</u></a>, a participatory action research (PAR) method.
       It seeks to bring positive social change in marginalised and minority communities by providing photographic training. Seeing it through their lense, we might better
       understand how they perceive the arts and its importance for their identity. </br></br>

      «Ethnographers should be interested in how informants use the content of the images as vessels in which to invest meanings and through which to produce and represent their knowledge, self-identities, experiences and emotions.»*
      </br>The photographs were collected on the ground (during the fieldwork) and online (via a Facebook group).
      The comments were mostly formed during the review process, which happened half a year after my stay.
    </br></br>
      A more detailed account of the whole process and its collaborative dimension can be found in the anthropological notes at the bottom of the page.
