  <h1>SPIRIT ~ Photographs</h1>
        <p>Photography belongs to the traditional methods of visual anthropology and for decades, it has been seen
        as an objective way to record and reveal the reality. The anthropologist would document the culture and its people
        from his/her own eye and disregard the inherent subjectivity, along with the power structures.
         </br>For this project, I was strongly inspired by the guidelines of <a href="http://www.photovoice.org/" target="_blank"><u>PhotoVoice</u></a>, a participatory action research (PAR) method.
         It seeks to bring positive social change in marginalised communities and minorities by providing photographic training. Seeing the world directly through the lense of these <a href="/the-women" target="_blank"><u>the women</u></a>, I hope to better
         understand how they perceive the arts and its importance for the development of their identities. </br>

«I choose the fire because back at the time, it represented life. Without fire, you can't stay warm nor cook food.
To thank the spirits, we burned objects or plants, such as sage. It is a unifying element, we gathered
around the fire for the telling of stories, the oral transmission.»</p>

«My sister Wapi went on a canoe trip with other youths from the three atikamekw communities and they were
 accompanied by elders. They crossed a vast part of the atikamekw territory. That's their arrival in Manawan.
 It was a very emotional moment, my family and I were really proud of her.»</p>
