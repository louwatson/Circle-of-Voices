          This research project was conducted with the collaboration of <a href="/the-women" target="_blank">six young Native women</a> 
          in Quebec in the summer of 2016. Centered around their paths, we explored the interplay between
          the process of cultural revitalization and the construction of their identity through four topics: land,
          language, art and spirit.</h5>
