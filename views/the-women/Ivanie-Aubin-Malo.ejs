  <h3>Short biography by <u><a href="/the-researcher" target="_blank">Louise Watson</a></u></h3>
  <p>Ivanie inherited her wolastoq origins (maliseet of <u><a href source="/the-communities/Cacouna">Viger</a></u>) though her mother. She grew up in the suburbs of Montreal, and decided to pursue an education in contemporary dance at 17 years old. Her final graduation project, in 2014, merged the culture of First Nations and contemporary dance. The year after, she traveled to Vancouver to learn the fancy shawl, a pow-wow dance. There, she met her mentor, Curtis Joe Miller, who has been an inspiring role model. Back in Quebec, she met groups of drummers, such as the Buffalo Hat Singers, who invited her to perform in various events. From there, she started organizing fancy-shawl workshops and taught the dance to children, youths and adults. At 25 years old, her desire to exchange, to share and to learn, brought her to integrate the organism Kina8at, being an intermediary between its members and young First Nations, on the transmission of ancestral knowledge. Besides, she still co-creates diverse contemporary dance projects, such as the collective Flamant. </p>

<h2>What do you do in life?</h2>

<p> «After I was 16, I went to post-secondary schools to learn dancing and be trained as a dancer. In 2014, I graduated from the contemporary dance school wit a personal project to end my study was to reconnect with my roots and my goal was to present a contemporary dance with an indigenous dimension.»
 «At the beginning of 2015, I wanted to learn fancy shawl dance, which is a pow-wow dance. So I went to Vancouver, I met Curtis Joe Miller, my mentor.»

<h2>What are the pow-wow ? </h2>
<audio src="/audio/entrevues/iva2.mp3" controls="true"/> </audio>
<p> audio + picture «The pow-wows are indigenous gatherings, though it’s also open to non-indigenous. Yes exactly, non-indigenous people are welcome. There are competitive and traditional pow-wows. In the competitive pow-wows, the dancers and the drummers have numbers, and in the traditional pow-wows, they don’t. That’s the main difference. Competitive, some people win, traditional ones there are no winners, everyone wins. In the pow-wows, there is crafting, food, traditional songs and dances. There is also contemporary dance. Fancy shawl counts among the contemporary dances, but contemporary doesn’t mean new from this year. It means new from 1920.»</p> </br>

<p> «Currently, it’s the missing and murdered indigenous women. I think we see that a lot, we are shown a lot the victims. I think we are seen as victims. And also as fighters. You know, it’s like both.» </p>

<h3>What makes your proud to be a Maliseet, a First Nation woman? </h3>
<p> «I am proud because there is a darker history behind all that, and we are still here. That makes me proud. Because I know it’s not up to me. It depends on my mother who always told me that I was Maliseet. It’s up to my grandfather, who said it again, that he was Amerindian, indigenous. It’s up to my great-grandfather, who still spoke his language but people said he talked a jargon. That makes me proud, to say that we never surrendered. It’s not a self-absorbed pride.» </p>
