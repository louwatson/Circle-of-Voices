<h3>What is Circle of Voices?</h3>
  <p>Circle of Voices is a digital anthropological research project aiming to bring educational awareness about the situation of Indigenous women and youths, and more broadly about Indigenous rights. It started in 2016 with young women from the Atikamekw, Abenaki and Wolastoqiyik/
Maliseet Nations in Quebec, Canada. The project explores cultural revitalization through four themes: land, language, art and spirituality. It merges collaborative methodologies with digital tools, and included the following activities: participatory photography workshops, sharing circles, sound recordings and video clips of traditional practices, inter-generational dance workshops (fancy shawl), and personal narratives (biographical interviews) with the women and with knowledge holders.
</br></br>The research project consists of an <u><a href="/the-research" target="_blank">academic writing</u></a> and an interactive website. circleofvoices.com is an attempt to use the web space to present anthropological academic knowledge and invite indigenous expertise and perspectives.</p>
